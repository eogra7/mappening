# Mappening

## Team Vision: 
An efficient and simple geo-tagging platform to display and allow lesser known events/activites to atttract an individual's attention. 
<br /> 

## Project Summary: 
Come find out what's happening on the map, or.... what's Mappening! 

Our project is a web-based application that allows users to interact with an in-browser map and view different geo-tagged events/activites that are happening nearby. These events/activites can be clicked to view a description as well as a geographical location; allowing users to attend any geo-tagged activity of their choosing. For organizers and users looking to advertise their events/activities, a form is available to submit necessary information required to create a geo-tag of their own.
